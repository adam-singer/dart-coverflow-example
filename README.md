A sample application of CSS3/HTML5/Dart. The coverflow loads a set of pictures and displays them in a carousel. Left/Right keys navigate and clicking on the photo displays a popup. This sample has 20 pictures so its probabaly best to load from filesystem. You can try the github pages, but I seem to have issues with some images loading and not loading.
